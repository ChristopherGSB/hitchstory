Screenplay Principle
====================

    You don't tell your audience your story, you SHOW them. You must learn to write a screenplay VISUALLY. Write what they will SEE and what they will HEAR.

An iron rule of screenplay writing is that you do not write what a character thinks. You must demonstrate via their actions and words
what they think. A common newbie approach is to write what characters are thinking.

Software specifications suffer from related problems:

* Overspecification - where a specification defines *how* a problem is to be achieved, rather than what problem is to be achieved.
* Underspecification - where a specification does not nail down a specification, leaving elements vague.
