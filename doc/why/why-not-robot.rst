Why not use the Robot Framework?
--------------------------------

It was actually the first trigger that made me write the hitchdev framework. The very idea that you
could write an executable language that failed on a particular line and *wouldn't tell you which line
it failed* on implied such an epic failure of imagination that I figured that I couldn't possibly make
something worse.
