Is HitchStory for writing "human writable" stories?
---------------------------------------------------

No. This is an explicit non-goal, unlike that of Cucumber.

It ought to be possible to write hitch stories with less training than is required
to be a programmer since the language is conceptually simpler than turing complete
programming languages. However, it still would require some training to write and instincts
that are generally only honed by programmers - e.g the instinct to DRY the code,
the instinct to parameterize and to generalize are not easily picked up by non-programmers.

Not every programmer has this skill either.

Stories should be *readable* by non-programmers, however, and it should be straightforward
for programmers to write stories collaboratively with product managers or customers (e.g.
using a projector or gathered around a laptop).
