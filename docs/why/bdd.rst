title: Is hitchstory a BDD language?
---

Yes and no.

Primarily, BDD is about customer collaboration on writing stories. It does not have
any technical requirements - simply jotting down an expected behavior on the back of a
napkin with a customer is technically considered BDD, no matter what tools are used after
that.

However, HitchStory can be used to make BDD easier for a number of reasons:

* The executable stories will be easier for non-programmers subject matter experts to read
than turing complete code (e.g. unit tests).

* The executable stories can also be used as a basis to generate documentation which customers
can use as a quick and preliminary means of acceptance testing.
