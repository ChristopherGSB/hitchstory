title: Screenplay Principle
---

    You don't tell your audience your story, you show them. You must learn to write a screenplay visually. Write what they will see and what they will hear.

An iron rule of screenplay writing is that you do not write what a character thinks. You must demonstrate via their actions and words what they think.

This parallels a similar problem with software specification:

* Overspecification - where a specification defines *how* a problem is to be achieved, rather than what problem is to be achieved.

* Underspecification - where a specification does not nail down a specification, leaving the desired behavior vague.
