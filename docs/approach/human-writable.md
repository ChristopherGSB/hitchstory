title: Is HitchStory for writing "human writable" stories?
---

No. Having "analysts" write stories instead of programmers is an explicit
non-goal, unlike that of Cucumber.

It ought to be possible to write hitch stories with less training than is required
to be a programmer since the language is conceptually simpler than turing complete
programming languages.

However, it still would require some training to write and instincts
that are generally only honed by programmers - e.g the instinct to DRY the code,
the instinct to parameterize and to generalize are often not present among non-programmers.

Stories, however, should be mostly readable by non-programmer stakeholders , however,
and it should be straightforward for programmers to write stories collaboratively
"BDD style" with stakeholders - e.g. product managers or customers gathered around a laptop.
