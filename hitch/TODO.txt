* Engine should be refreshed before running a second run?
* Don't convert mapping validated step code to string.
* Run tests with specified params via code.
* Params are parsed as a special "orred" YAML.
* Make everything in preconditions / params schema optional.
* Params should match the schema of the precondition or step?
* Update steps make save only run if something actually changed so as not to mess up indenting.
* Rename preconditions -> given
* Rename scenario - steps
* Examples -- parameters via a name.
* Counter examples -- known failures, params with a name.
* Example generator --

given
steps
examples:

default params:
  python version: 3.5.0
  ruamel version: 
  
examples:
  default:
    python version: 3.5.0
    ruamel version: 3.11.0
  python 2:
    python version: 2.7.10
    ruamel version: 3.11.0

examples:


parameters from:


preconditions (should use given)
scenario (should use steps)


* continue from -- scenario followed on from.

* based on -- precondiions and pparameterarameters inherited

* CANNOT DO BOTH

* Inherit from story - use slugify.

* given instead of preconditions, steps instead of scenario.

* Use non-ascii characters in all tests.

* poststep method - self.poststep(self, previous_step)

* prestep method - self.prestep(self, following_step)

* pre_testrun / post_testrun - run once when any group of stories is run - use for build? Does not work if build preconditions fail.

* global parent story.

* Invalid YAML, raise exception that specifies which file the exception is in, and swallows the YAML exception.

* kwargs

* expected exceptions.

* hitchstory DEBUG mode.

* strategies --- strategies for params.

5) Ctrl-C / abort / SIGTERM

6) raise clearer exception - invalid types in schema.

7) raise clearer exception - invalid about params - preconditions, name, description, params in about schema.

8) Many different kinds of inheritance:

-- take preconditions, don't take preconditions, start at the end of the story, start at the beginning of the story, ignore the story - STEP INHERITED.
-- step bundles?
