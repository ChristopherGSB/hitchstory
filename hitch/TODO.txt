* Update steps make save only run if something actually changed so as not to mess up indenting
* Rename expected_exception -> suppress_failure_stacktrace(
* Examples -- parameters via a story name (examples:)
* Counter examples -- known failures, params with a name.
* Use non-ascii characters in all tests.

* poststep method - self.poststep(self, previous_step)

* prestep method - self.prestep(self, following_step)

* group_setup(self, given_list) / group_teardown - run once when any group of stories is run - use for build? Does not work if build preconditions fail.
