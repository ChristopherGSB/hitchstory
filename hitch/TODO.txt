* Make stacktrace appear in set_up. 
* variations should be able to contain any INFO parameter.
* Make it possible to put in a name of an unimplemented test and blank file.
* given equals ( "python version": Default(Str(), from_parameter"python version", default 3.5.0) 
* self.current_step.update(will_output=x) will fail if key is actually "will output"
* "Start line of YAML with list" -- why does it fail if you have not specified code?
* Fail with a more sensible error message when validators fail on steps.
* Print to screen or log to file while running.
* Make exception code yellow not red. Orange for runpy.
* Give line numbers to blue YAML snippets indicating failure.
* "Capture" mode and print mode (default)
* Params should match the schema of the precondition or step.
* Update steps make save only run if something actually changed so as not to mess up indenting
* Rename expected_exception -> suppress_failure_stacktrace(
* Examples -- parameters via a story name (examples:)
* Counter examples -- known failures, params with a name.
* Use non-ascii characters in all tests.

* poststep method - self.poststep(self, previous_step)

* prestep method - self.prestep(self, following_step)

* group_setup(self, given_list) / group_teardown - run once when any group of stories is run - use for build? Does not work if build preconditions fail.

* kwargs story, demonstrate that conversion to underscore case does not happen in kwargs whereas it does in named args.

* *args story.

* expected exceptions.

* hitchstory DEBUG mode.

6) raise clearer exception - invalid types in schema.

7) raise clearer exception - invalid about params - preconditions, name, description, params in about schema.
