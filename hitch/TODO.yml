- Unexpected key not in schema 'code' (on step) // StepNotFound specify story name.
- Make 'about' a default property on all stories.
- Make exception code yellow not red.
- Add 'required' and default arguments to GivenProperty and InfoProperty.
- Rewrite automatically on successful completion of a story with updates.
- Blank or file with comments should be completely valid as should story without anything in it.
- Story kind:
  - regular
  - stub (no data on story - just a name)
  - abstract (no steps - but has metadata and/or preconditions)
  - known failure (story will fail build if it passes and succeed if it fails)
- Fix inheritance from 3rd story down.- Rewriting fails if it is being done on a parent story?
- Give line numbers to blue YAML snippets indicating failure.
- Add defaults argument to GivenProperty and InfoProperty.
- Add inherit_by argument to GivenProperty and InfoProperty.
- Add ParameterDefinition: |
    parameter_definition=ParameterDefinition(
        valid_browser=ParameterProperty(
            schema=Enum(list_of_valid_browser_name_templatess),
            validate=validate_func,  ????
            default="Firefox",
            hypothesis_strategies=generate_browser,
        ),
        python_2_version=ParameterProperty(
            schema=Enum(list_of_things),
            validate=validate_func,
            default="Firefox",
            hypothesis_strategy=generate_browser,
        ),
    )
            

- Examples -- parameters via a story name (examples:)
- Counter examples -- known failures, params with a name - avoid.
- Use non-ascii characters in all tests.
- poststep method - self.poststep(self, previous_step)
- prestep method - self.prestep(self, following_step)
- group_setup(self, given_list) / group_teardown - run once when any group of stories is run. For use doing build steps and possibly starting services that take a long time to start up and can have their state reset while running. Should get all preconditions for all stories that you are planning to run.
- Reserved key words on step names (e.g. preconditions, given, anything that is a property on the story, the word 'in', etc.)
- kwargs story, demonstrate that conversion to underscore case does not happen in kwargs whereas it does in named args.
- *args story.
- debugging_hitchstory_itself() mode - do not inhibit stack traces from the framework.
